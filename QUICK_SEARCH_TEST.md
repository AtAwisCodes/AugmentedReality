# Quick Search Testing Checklist

## Test Now (After Latest Fix)

### Step-by-Step Test:

1. **Open the app**
   - Make sure you're on the home page (Videos tab)

2. **Tap the search icon** in the top-right corner
   - You should see the search interface open
   - You should see: "Type to search for videos"

3. **Type a search query** (try one of these):
   - "plastic"
   - "recycle"
   - "waste"
   - Any word you think appears in your video titles

4. **Press Enter** on your keyboard (or tap the search button on mobile keyboard)
   - Search interface should close
   - You should return to home page
   - **LOOK FOR**:
     - Green banner at top saying "Filtering by: 'your query'"
     - Only videos matching your query should show
     - If no matches, you'll see "No videos found" message

5. **Check the console/debug output**
   - Should see this sequence:
   ```
   DEBUG: buildResults called with query: "your query"
   DEBUG YtVideoviewModel.setSearchQuery: searchQuery is now "your query"
   DEBUG YtVideoviewModel.setSearchQuery: notifyListeners() called
   DEBUG: After setSearchQuery, viewModel.searchQuery = "your query"
   DEBUG: Closing search interface
   DEBUG VideosPage: searchQuery="your query", combinedList.length=X
   DEBUG VideosPage: filteredList.length=Y
   ```

## What Changed in Latest Fix

### Before:
```dart
setSearchQuery(query.trim());
close(context, query);  // Closed immediately
```

### After:
```dart
setSearchQuery(query.trim());
Future.microtask(() {
  close(context, query);  // Closes after current frame completes
});
```

**Why**: This ensures the state update completes and propagates to all listeners before the search interface closes. The microtask runs after the current synchronous code completes but before the next frame is rendered.

## If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Console Output Present?
- **NO console output**: Enter key not triggering buildResults()
  - Try using the mobile keyboard's search/enter button
  - Check if keyboard is in correct input mode

- **Console shows query being set but videos not filtering**: 
  - Copy all console output and share it
  - Specifically look for the "DEBUG VideosPage" lines

### Check 2: Green Banner Visible?
- **Banner appears**: State is updating correctly in home_page
- **No banner**: Consumer might not be rebuilding
  - Check if you're on the Videos tab (page == 0)

### Check 3: Video Count
- Check console for: `DEBUG VideosPage: combinedList.length=X`
  - If X = 0: No videos loaded yet (wait for loading to complete)
  - If X > 0 but filteredList.length = 0: No matches for your query (try different words)

## Alternative Test Queries

Try these if your first query doesn't find anything:

1. Common words: "the", "a", "is", "in", "and"
   - These should match most videos

2. Your channel name or common YouTube channel names

3. Very short queries: "e", "i", "a"
   - Single letters appear in almost everything

## Clear Search

To reset and see all videos again:
- Click the X button in the green banner, OR
- Open search and click the clear (X) button in the search bar

## Expected Behavior Summary

✅ **Correct behavior**:
1. Type query
2. Press Enter
3. Return to home page
4. See green banner: "Filtering by: 'query'"
5. See only matching videos
6. Can clear with X button
7. Can search again with new query

❌ **Incorrect behavior** (what we're fixing):
1. Type query
2. Press Enter
3. Return to home page
4. No banner appears
5. All videos still show (not filtered)
6. Console shows query was set but nothing happened
