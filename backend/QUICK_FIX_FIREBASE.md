#  Quick Fix: Wrong Firebase Credentials File

##  Current Problem
You have `google-services.json` (Android app file) instead of the **Admin SDK service account key** (backend server file).

##  Solution: Download the CORRECT File

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console
Open: **https://console.firebase.google.com/project/rexplore-61772/settings/serviceaccounts/adminsdk**

(Direct link to your project's service accounts page)

### Step 2: Generate Admin SDK Key
1. You'll see a section called **"Firebase Admin SDK"**
2. Click the **"Generate new private key"** button
3. Click **"Generate key"** in the popup
4. A file like `rexplore-61772-firebase-adminsdk-xxxxx.json` will download

### Step 3: Replace the Wrong File
1. **Delete** the current `C:\ReXplore\Thesis\backend\firebase-credentials.json`
2. **Rename** the downloaded file to `firebase-credentials.json`
3. **Move** it to `C:\ReXplore\Thesis\backend\`

### Step 4: Restart Backend
```powershell
# Press CTRL+C in the terminal running the backend
# Then run:
cd C:\ReXplore\Thesis\backend
python app.py
```

###  Expected Output:
```
Firestore initialized with service account credentials
Starting Meshy AR Backend Server...
Server running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
 * Running on http://192.168.100.25:5000
```

##  What's the Difference?

| File | Purpose | Has `client_email`? | Used By |
|------|---------|---------------------|---------|
| `google-services.json` | Android app config |  No | Flutter app |
| **Admin SDK JSON** | Server credentials |  **Yes** | Backend (Python) |

You accidentally used the Android file for the backend server. The Admin SDK file has `client_email`, `private_key`, and `token_uri` fields needed for server-side authentication.

##  Once Fixed:

The workflow will be **fully operational**:
-  Backend running at `http://192.168.100.25:5000`
-  Firestore connected
-  Video uploads work
-  3D model generation works
-  AR display works

You're almost there! Just need the correct credentials file.
